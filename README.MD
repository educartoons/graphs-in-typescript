# Implementation of Graphs 

This repository was generated in my Live Session Coding #2. May 31, 2020.
I taught what the data structure *graph* is and its applications.
This repository does not contain the front-end application used, that will be included in a separeted repository.

## Theory 

I will be adding elements to this section in the next days. Be patient with me.

## Graph class 

The *Graph* class contains the next properties and methods

Properties 

- nodes 
- edges 
- routes

Methods

- [x] Add Node
- [x] Add Edge 
- [x] Remove Node
- [x] Remove Edge
- [x] Traverse using Depth First
- [x] Traverse using Breadth First
- [x] Find all the possible paths from a origin node to destination node
- [ ] Dijkstra
- [ ] Improving Dijkstra using Fibonacci Heaps
